	The Story Of The"TheRaceSystem"
	</h2>
	<p>
		Hi, I am david and I am the artist behind "TheRaceSystem", I always like art but I was lazy, now we are not talking about me being lazy it is the of "TheRaceSystem". I first got into making computer drawing when I was 11 when I got my first computer, I was lazy at that time and I still am...anyway I started drawing concept art for the "TheRaceSystem" at 12 April 2021, "TheRaceSystem" was inspired by foxes because foxes live in groups of diferent colors of fur an more, I first made a sketch of the "TheRaceSystem" then made the painting  after that I colored it, that is all of the story and now I am selling 5 copies of "theRaceSystem"
